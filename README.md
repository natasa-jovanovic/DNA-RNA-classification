# DNA-RNA-classification

In this project, a classification of several types of genetic material was performed. In the first part, microRNA nucleotides are classified into canonical microRNAs and myrtrons. One-hot encoding was applied first, and then the obtained data were presented in the form of matrices and classified using convolutional neural networks.

The second part involved the classification of DNA material into six types that correspond to different types of viruses. The architecture of the convolutional neural network was also used for the classification, but it was preceded by K-mer encoding.
